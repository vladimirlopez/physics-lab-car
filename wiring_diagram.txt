  Wiring Diagram for Physics Lab Arduino Car
  
  ARDUINO UNO CONNECTIONS:
  
  Motor Driver (L298N):
  - Pin 5  → ENA (Left Motor Speed Control)
  - Pin 6  → IN1 (Left Motor Direction)
  - Pin 9  → ENB (Right Motor Speed Control) 
  - Pin 10 → IN2 (Right Motor Direction)
  - Pin 7  → IN3 (Left Motor Direction)
  - Pin 4  → IN4 (Right Motor Direction)
  
  Note: Adjust pin assignments based on your specific motor driver shield
  
  IR Receiver (VS1838B):
  - Pin 11 → Signal
  - 5V     → VCC
  - GND    → GND
  
  Buzzer:
  - Pin 8  → Positive
  - GND    → Negative
  
  LED (Status Indicator):
  - Pin 13 → Built-in LED (no external wiring needed)
  
  Power:
  - Motor Driver: Connect to external battery pack (6-12V)
  - Arduino: Can be powered via USB or battery pack through Vin
  
  MOTOR CONNECTIONS TO L298N:
  - Left Motor:  OUT1 and OUT2
  - Right Motor: OUT3 and OUT4
  
  IMPORTANT: Ensure common ground between Arduino and motor driver!
